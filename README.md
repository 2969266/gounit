GoUnit is a unit tests generator for Go programming language

The goal of the project is to generate convenient test stubs and to improve integration with text editors and IDEs.

There are plugins for
* [Vim plugin](https://github.com/hexdigest/gounit-vim) that introduces the :GoUnit command which generates a test for the selected function.
* [Emacs](https://github.com/hexdigest/GoUnit-Emacs)
* [Atom](https://github.com/hexdigest/atom-gounit)
* [Sublime](https://github.com/hexdigest/gounit-sublime)

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/hexdigest/gounit/cmd/gounit
```

## Usage of GoUnit

This will generate test stubs for all functions and method in file.go

```
  $ gounit gen -i file.go 
```

Run
```
  $ gounit help
```

for more options

## Custom test templates

If you're not satisfied with the code produced by the default GoUnit test template you can always write your own!
You can use [minimock template](https://github.com/hexdigest/gounit/blob/master/templates/minimock) as an example.
Here is now to switch to the custom template:

```
  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexdigest/gounit/master/templates/minimock > minimock
  $ gounit template add minimock
  $ gounit template list

    gounit templates installed

       * default
         minimock

  $ gounit template use minimock
```

Minimock template produces test stubs that are aware of the mocks generated by the [minimock](https://github.com/gojuno/minimock) mock
generator. By using both of these tools you can automate the process of writing tests and focus on the test cases rather than 
routine operations.

## Integration with editors and IDEs

To ease an integration of GoUnit with IDEs "gen" subcommand has a "-json" flag.
When -json flag is passed GoUnit reads [JSON requests](https://github.com/hexdigest/gounit/blob/master/client.go#L5) from Stdin in a loop and produces [JSON responses](https://github.com/hexdigest/gounit/blob/master/client.go#L16) with generated test(s) that are written to Stdout.
Using this mode you can generate as many tests as you want by running GoUnit executable only once.
